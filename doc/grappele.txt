INTRODUCTION                                           *grappele-introduction*

Grappele saves your last |G| movement and provides a way to easily repeat it.
I often find myself typing `278G` for example only to realise that I'm in the
wrong window. I'll then have to switch to the window I was originally looking
at and type `278G` again. With Grappele, I can use |G| normally and if I mess
up, the last |G| command can be quickly repeated with a mapping.
